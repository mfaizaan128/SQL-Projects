SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country WHERE Population > 1000000; 

-- Output: 154. The number of rows counted can be limited by specifying the category using the "WHERE" Clause.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country WHERE Population> 100000000 AND Continent= 'Europe'; 

-- Output: 1. Further specification can be made using the "AND" clause.
